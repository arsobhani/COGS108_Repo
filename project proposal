Project Proposal

Our question is:
How do changes in California temperatures between 2015-2018 influence the severity of wildfires that occur in California?
We would like to investigate whether there is a correlation between the severity of wildfires in California and the temperatures of those

We hypothesize that greater temperatures in California will lead to a greater severity of wildfires in California.

From our data, we will gather information on burning acreage and the average temperature of the area, so we have two continous variables.
These data points will be stored in dataframes. We would have around 2,400 observations. We would try to observe the average temperatures 
in California counties and the acreage burnage in those California counties in the same months, from 2015 to 2018.
